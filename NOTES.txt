For the project as a whole:

1. We need task / bug tracking within the week!


For Event Manager:

1. EventManager::Update() could theoritically run forever if there are enough events.

StartEventProcessing is called in the while loop that checks for events.  
If more events occurs before the processing finishes, the while loop will continue. 
A timer could stop the update at some point.

2. EventManager::StartEventProcessing() might limit the types of events that can be dispatched.

What if an object wants to know if ANY mouse button was pressed rather than a specific one?
