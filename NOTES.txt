Sprite:

1. Add SDL texture loading into the class. 
The game programmer should only need to provide a filepath of an image in order to create a sprite.

Button:

1. Should contain a sprite object with which to draw the button.
2. The game programmer should have a way to set the 'onUp' or 'onDown' sequences/frames
3. Every button should be subscribed to (and handle) mouse click events

Physics:

1. Physically restricting objects from leaving the world bounds should be an option, not automatic.
2. We need overrided collision functions that handle 
  a. unit vs. unit 
  b. unit vs. group
  c. group vs. group
